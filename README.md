# About this:
The goal is to have a Discord Bot that is fed information Django + sqlit3.
Currently the bot supports, tags, joining pugs, leave pugs, promoting pugs, listing current pugs, and more. 
I intend on reorganizing api/views.py soon, but that is where the important API code is stored and the models of course are found in api/models.py.
The bot is found in pugbot/botv2.py and the commands relevant to its function are in pugbot/cogs/register.py.
Special thanks to Vicarious for help on the Discord.py side of things. I've been writing this solo, so expect many updates and cleaning of code.


Last but never least, come play [Unreal Tournament](https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/)  with us in Discord at [UT4PUGS Discord](https://ut4pugs.us)
